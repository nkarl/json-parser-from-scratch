I design and implement a JSON parser in Haskell.

I have very little idea of I am supposed to do right now. However, I do have a few leads to start with:

- https://www.json.org/json-en.html
    - containing the resource pertaining to the grammar and syntax of JSON.
- a tokenizer
    - parses and assigns meaning to some symbols.
- a lexer
    - more complex than tokenizer.
    - parses and assigns meaning to more symbols.
- a parser
    - more complex than lexer.
    - parses and assigns meaning to symbols according to some grammar and syntax.
